# ESP32 Embedded Systems

A growing collection of ESP32 projects exploring embedded systems concepts. Each project includes implementations in both Arduino and ESP-IDF frameworks.

## Structure

Projects live under `src/`, organized by topic. Each topic contains an `arduino/` and `esp-idf/` subdirectory with its respective implementation.

```
src/
├── intro/        # LED control, GPIO basics
├── adc/          # Analog-to-digital conversion
├── pwm/          # Pulse-width modulation
├── debouncing/   # Button debouncing
├── i2c-lcd/      # I2C LCD display
├── uart/         # UART serial communication
└── ...           # More to come
```

Each project contains its own README with implementation details.
